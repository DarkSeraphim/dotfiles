# Usage
- Clone this repo
- Clone the submodules using `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Run the install script `./install` (linux / unix, the dotbot folder has a windows script as well)
- ???
- Profit! It won't override existing files, so you need to manually delete those files if you want to use my dotfiles.
